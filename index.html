            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Homework has been a traditional part of education for decades, but growing evidence suggests it may be doing more harm than good. Students today face increasing pressure, stress, and burnout from excessive homework assignments that extend the school day well into evenings and weekends.</p>
                <p>This presentation argues that homework should be banned to improve student mental health, promote better learning outcomes, and allow students to develop holistically beyond academics.</p>

                    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>Excessive homework contributes to stress, anxiety, and burnout among students. Banning homework allows students to rest, recharge, and maintain better mental well-being.</p>

                    <h3>Work-Life Balance</h3>
                    <p>Students need time for family, hobbies, sports, and social activities. Homework robs them of essential downtime and personal development opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Quality learning happens during school hours with teacher guidance. Forced homework often leads to rushed, low-quality work that doesn't enhance understanding.</p>
